# If you're using Redis replication, you can use `ReplicationClient` to send
# read commands to replicas and reduce load on the primary. This can be important
# when your Redis primary is CPU-bound.
#
# The commands that will be routed to replicas are listed in
# `Redis::READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`.
#
# NOTE: Redis replication does not provide consistency guarantees. Every
# mechanism in Redis to improve consistency, such as
# [WAIT](https://redis.io/commands/wait/#consistency-and-wait), is best-effort,
# but not guaranteed. If you require strong consistency from Redis, stick to
# using `Redis::Client`. if you require strong consistency but your Redis primary
# is CPU-bound, you may need to either choose between consistency and performance
# or move that workload out of Redis.
#
# This client is useful for operations where strong consistency isn't typically
# needed, such as caching, full-text search with `Redis::FullText#search`,
# querying time-series data with `Redis::TimeSeries#mrange`, checking the current
# state of larger data structures without blocking the primary, etc.
#
# ## Explicitly routing commands to a primary or replica
#
# This class provides `on_primary` and `on_replica` methods to ensure your
# command is routed to the server type you want. This is useful in several
# scenarios:
#
# - you want to ensure you retrieve a value that is consistent with the state of
#   the primary server — for example a value that changes frequently and you
#   need the canonical state for observability purposes
# - a read-only command is routed to a primary because this client does not yet
#   know about it
#   - You can add commands to `Redis::READ_ONLY_COMMANDS` in one-off cases
#   - Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jgaskins/redis/issues) or
#     [pull request](https://github.com/jgaskins/redis/pulls) to add it, as well
#
# ## Topology changes
#
# If the replication topology changes (for example, new replicas are added,
# existing ones removed, or the primary failed over), `ReplicationClient` will
# automatically pick up the changes. You can set how often it checks for these
# changes with the `topology_ttl` argument to the constructor or leave it at its
# default of 10 seconds.
